# Lung-cancer-detection.
An image processing technique is built to detect diseases at early stage of cancer so the patient can take the treatment at early stages.The time factor is major factor to discover the abnormal tissue in target x-ray images. The accuracy and the quality of image is one the major core factor of this research.

#Dataset used for training and testing the model is a public dataset.

This model is trained to identify from the images whether the images contains the cancer cells or not.

#There are two versions of the model here
A simple CNN model with image augumentation techniques.
Training Accuracy : 94% (approx)
Validation Accuracy: 95% (approx)

#A transfer learning model using Inception Network with Image augumentation techniques
Training Accuracy : 98% (approx)
Validation Accuracy: 98% (approx)
